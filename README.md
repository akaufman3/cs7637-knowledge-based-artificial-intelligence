Knowledge Based AI study materials I compiled for this course.

Course Description: "The twin goals of knowledge-based artificial intelligence (AI) are to build AI agents capable of human-level intelligence and gain insights into human cognition.  

The learning goals of the Knowledge-Based AI course are to develop an understanding of (1) the basic architectures, representations and techniques for building knowledge-based AI agents, and (2) issues and methods of knowledge-based AI. The main learning strategies are learning-by-example and learning-by-doing. Thus, the course puts a strong emphasis on homework assignments and programming projects. The course will cover three kinds of topics: core topics such as knowledge representation, planning, constraint satisfaction, case-based reasoning, knowledge revision, incremental concept learning, and explanation-based learning; common tasks such as classification, diagnosis, and design; and advanced topics such as analogical reasoning, visual reasoning, and meta-reasoning."
